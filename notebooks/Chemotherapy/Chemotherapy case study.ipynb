    "In this case study, we extend the work of  [Bertsimas et al. (2016)](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2363) in the design of chemotherapy regimens for advanced gastric cancer. Given a new study cohort and study characteristics, [Bertsimas et al. (2016)](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2363) optimize a chemotherapy regimen to maximize the cohort’s survival subject to a constraint on overall toxicity. Chemotherapy regimens are particularly challenging to optimize, since they involve multiple drugs given at potentially varying dosages, and they present risks for multiple adverse events that must be managed. This example highlights the generalizability of OptiCL to complex domains with multiple decisions and learned functions. \n",

    "We have several learned constraints which must be simultaneously satisfied, and we also learn the objective function directly as a predictive model. The use of clinical trial data forces us to consider each cohort as an observation, rather than an individual, since only aggregate measures are available. Thus, our model optimizes a cohort’s treatment."

    "The contextual variables ($\\boldsymbol{w}$) consist of various cohort and study summary variables. The inclusion of fixed, i.e., non-optimization, features allows us to account for differences in baseline health status and risk across study cohorts. These features are included in the predictive models but then are fixed in the optimization model to reflect the group for whom we are generating a prescription. We assume that there are no unobserved confounding variables in this prescriptive setting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The treatment variables ($\\boldsymbol{x}$) encode a chemotherapy regimen. A regimen is defined by a set of drugs, each with an administration schedule of potentially varied dosages throughout a chemotherapy cycle. We characterize a regimen by drug indicators and each drug's average daily dose and maximum instantaneous dose in the cycle.\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcomes of interest ($\\boldsymbol{y}$) consist of overall survival, to be included as the objective ($y_{OS}$),and various toxicities, to be included as constraints   ($y_i, \\ i \\in \\mathcal{Y}_C$).\n",

    "\\begin{align*}\n",

    "\n",
    "**Trust region**\n",
    "\n",
    "The trust region, $\\mathcal{X}(\\boldsymbol{w})$, plays two crucial roles in the formulation. First, it ensures that the predictive models are applied within their valid bounds and not inappropriately extrapolated. It also naturally enforces a notion of \"clinically reasonable\" treatments. It prevents drugs from being prescribed at doses outside of previously observed bounds, and it requires that the drug combination must have been previously seen (although potentially in different doses). It is nontrivial to explicitly characterize what constitutes a realistic treatment, and the convex hull provides a data-driven solution that integrates directly into the model framework. Furthermore, the convex hull implicitly enforces logical constraints between the different dimensions of $\\boldsymbol{x}$. For example, a drug's average and instantaneous dose must be 0, if the drug's binary indicator is set to 0: this does not need to be explicitly included as a constraint, since this is true of all observed treatment regimens. The only explicit constraint required here is that the indicator variables $\\boldsymbol{x}_b$ are binary."
