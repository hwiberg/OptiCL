    "# The Palatable Diet Problem  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Description.** The Diet Problem is the first large-scale optimization problem to be solved with the Simplex algorithm by Jack Laderman in [1947](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/fileadmin/inf/d1/teaching/winter18/Ideen/Materialien/Dantzig-Diet.pdf). The basic formulation of this problem consists of minimizing the cost of a food basket while meeting the specified nutrient requirements. In this notebook, we solve The Palatable Diet Problem (TPDP), where the basic model is extended with a constraint on the food basket palatability. An explicit formula of the palatability constraint is unknown, but we have data on several food baskets and the respective palatability score. First, we define a conceptual model with the *known constraint*. Then, OptiCL is used to learn and embed the palatability constraint.  \n",
    "(*TPDP is part of a larger optimization problem which simultaneously  optimizes  the  food  basket  to  be  delivered,  the  sourcing  plan,  the  delivery  plan, and  the  transfer  modality  of  a  month-long  food  supply in a Wolrd Food Program setting ([Maragno et al., 2021])*).\n",
